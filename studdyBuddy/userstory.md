# Description of the application
The StuddyBuddy application tries to connect students by having a registration platform that gathers information about when and where students are working. StuddyBuddy let´s the user register their name, which room they are working in, which course they are working on and which timeperiod they are working. The information is gathered by using a registration page with textfields and saving the input in a file. The user gets feedback with the saved information if the registration was successful.

# User story
As a student I would like to be updated and informed when fellow students are on campus and also what they are working on.

The user is in need of knowing when fellow students, specifically their friends, are on campus, at the library or other school-related places. It is practical to be able to register name, course, time period and room, in order to enhance collaboration amongst students. The registration should just consist of a simple text, but it is desirable that every field is used, in order to make the registration as informative and organized as possible. 

## Important to be able to see:
- fields for registration
- what you need to register in each field
- “notification” if an input is invalid in a certain field
- that the registration was successful

## Important to be able to do:
- write text in registration-field
- have several chances to write a valid input in all fields
